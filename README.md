# This is Prusa iteration 3
Published under GPL v3

Forked from [josefprusa's Prusa i3](https://github.com/josefprusa/Prusa3/) repo.

This build has been modified to use only M8/ 5.16" threaded rod with a laser cut wood/plastic frame. Models have been exported individually for ease of printing on differently sized machines.

Printed Parts
-------------

All printable models are in the printed_parts folder. Compiled STLs are in the output subfolder.

The configuration file has been modified to use only M8 threaded rods in the lower frame. Holes in the y-axis corners have been shrunken accordingly. This build also uses GT2-2mm belts, lm8uu linear bearings and idlers with 608 bearings and large washers.

X-end components have been modified for M8 threaded rod on the z-axis with strengthened M8 nut traps.

Additionally added models are:

 * [Parametric pulley](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:16627) by droftarts, released CC-BY-SA.
 * [Z half coupler v2](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:22422) by deezmaker, released GPLv3.

Frame
-----

DXFs are forked from [thetazzbot's Prusa_LC](https://github.com/thetazzbot/Prusa3_LC) repo and can be found in the frame folder. The plans have been modified for M8 threaded rod on the Y-axis and electronics mounting holes have been added.
